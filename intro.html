		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p> Super Smash Bros is a series of fighting video games that features many characters from other established video game franchises.
		While the developer intended for it to be a fun party game, the community has created a different way to play the game
		to make it more competitive. Ledgetrapping is a technique used in more recent titles in the series that involves the player
		performing the technique "trapping" the opposing player at the edge of the stage by restricting their options of getting back. I will be focusing on the aspects of ledgetrapping
		found in the most recent installment, Super Smash Bros Ultimate (SSBU) for the Nintendo Switch. Here is a cool community-made documentary if you are interested in the competitive scene: </p>
		<a href="https://www.metagamedoc.com/">It's quite long so don't feel pressured to watch it!</a>
		<p> This documentary focuses on the history of Super Smash Bros Melee for the Nintendo Gamecube. It's an extremely old game, but is kept alive by the support of the competitive community.
		Despite the lack of support from the official company, Nintendo, the Super Smash Bros community continues to keep the competitive scene thriving. The community
		hosts social gatherings called tournaments where competitive players can find new people to play with locally and test their skill against the best. Tournaments are categorized differently based on how many people attend and the prize pool. 
		The biggest tournament is usually referred to as a "major". A major tournament usually includes a large majority of the best players the community has to offer. The community was going to hold a world tour near
		the beginning of 2020, but due to certain COVID-19, it never saw the light of day. Fortunately, they have released information about the return of the Smash Bros World Tour recently for the new year of 2021.
		In short, tournaments are what keep the community alive and it's an easy way to meet new people and make a name for yourself. The community has been in a rough spot ever since COVID hit and the recent allegations against top players, but I believe the
		community can recover and grow. Despite being such a niche hobby, our history is really interesting and I recommend you try to learn more!
