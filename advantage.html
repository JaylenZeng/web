	<h1> Advantages </h1>
<p> Ledgetrapping provides many benefits when performed correctly and consistently. Being able to ledgetrap your opponnent 
can quickly change the momentum of the match. </p>


<p> The entire basis of ledgetrapping is the huge advantage of your position when compared to your opponnent. The ledge (also known as the edge) is any part of the map/stage that
your character can grab onto. It is usually found at the end of the main platform. As a result, the edge is generally an important aspect in the battle between the person trying
to recover back onto the stage and the other player who is trying to stop them. Because of the unique nature of KOing your opponent in this game, utilizing the ledge to knockout your opponent
is a common strategy. </p>

<h6> ^The red part represents the ledge </h6>
<p> When your opponent is on the ledge, their options decreases significantly. If they were already onstage, they could make use of all of the moves in their character's arsenal.
However, when they are on the ledge they are limited to only six primary options and sometimes a character-specific option. These six options are: </p>
</br>
<ol>
  <li> Neutral getup</li>
  <li> getup attack </li>
  <li> roll </li>
  <li> release </li>
  <li> stall </li>
  <li> jump </li>
</ol>
</br>

<p>Knowing this, the player onstage has a huge advantage over the player on the ledge.
This is because the player onstage has their entire moveset while the player on the ledge will only have a few options. The goal of the player onstage is prevent their opponent from
getting back onstage. This is where the "trapping" part of ledgetrapping comes into play. By covering their potential ledge options, not only do you prevent them from returning to a neutral position, but you also slowly
build up damage on your opponent. When done correctly, ledgetrapping can sometimes win you the game. </p>
