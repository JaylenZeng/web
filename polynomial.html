	<h1> My Favorite Polynomial! </h1>

<body>
	<p> 
	There are countless reasons why I decided to choose this polynomial. In fact, if I were to go into full detail about
	the reasons why I decided to choose this polynomial in particular, we would be here for centuries. Fortuantely, I decided
	to keep this brief. For starters, my polynomial has a beautiful structure along with only utilizing some of the most
	beautiful numbers known to mankind. You could argue that this is purely subjective, however I disagree. When you come to
	reach the level of understanding of a polynomial connoisseur such as myself, you come to realize the smaller, more wonderful
	aspects of numbers. Not only that, but I despise polynomials who don't factor beautifully. A fluid and elegant process of factoring
	is necessary for a polynomial to be considered high class. Ugly, troublesome polynomials don't deserve this title. The connection
	between me and my polynomial goes beyond the stars and yet some people acuse me of simply searching up 5 term polynomials
	on google. How absurd! I have never been more offended in my life! What drew me in was this polynomial's subtle but intense exterior. At first glance,
	it may seem like a rather simple problem. You would not be wrong with this observation. Despite this, some people fail to understand that sometimes
	the simple things in life are of utmost importance and I don't blame them for easily losing sight of life's simplistic luxuries. In our day to day life,
	it is easy to lose sight of the path ahead of you. I too, was one of these people. Wandering senselessly around the world, searching for life's
	one purpose. However, I have now seen the light. With this polynomial, my entire being and way of life was turned around in an instant. My understanding
	of the world has changed drastically and it is all thanks to the subtle complexity of this polynomial. Go ahead, laugh at me all you want. It no longer matters to me,
	a man who has thrown away all sense of shame in order to pursue his one true love and desire.
