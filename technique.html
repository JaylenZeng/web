		<h1> Common Techniques </h1>
		<p> Now the most important part. How to actually perform it! Now naturally, it is impossible to know which of the 6 options your opponent
		is going to choose everytime. Unless your opponent does the same thing time and time again, they will eventually escape your deadly trap.
		So how do you know which option your opponent will choose? Although it isn't humanely possible to guess correctly everytime, there are ways
		to make your life a lot easier and it all revolve around positioning. Basically, you can limit the number of options your opponent has from
		6 to a more manageable amount like 2 or 3. You can do this by covering certain options and encourage your opponent to choose other ones. What do I mean by this?
		Here is an example. You can position your character to cover two options: Neutral getup and getup attack by simply holding shield right next to the ledge. If your opponent
		decides to pick either of these options, they will be serverely punished. Why? Because you are right there ready to hit them if they try to get back up. This doesn't directly
		take away your opponent's options, but it does discourage them from picking certain ones, narrowing down their decision. </p>

		<p> There is no specific, optimal way to ledgetrap. SSBU has a total of 78 characters as of February 2021. Some characters will have specific methods of ledgetrapping.
		However in the end, it is up to the player to find a ledgetrapping method that they find comfortable. </p>

		<p> In addition, since each character has their own unique moveset, they might have access to certain options that other characters don't have! For example, the character Diddy Kong's down special
			allows him to pull out a banana. When the opponnent steps on the banana, they will obviously slip on it. As a result, Diddy Kong players can strategically place this banana to cover one of their opponent's options.
			Every character can have its own unique method of ledgetrapping. Feel free to experiment with them in training mode! If you don't fully understand your character, consider joining a character discord server. 
			Each character has a dedicated discord server with plently of people. You are bound to find or learn something new!
